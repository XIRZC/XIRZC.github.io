I am Zicong Xie, a postgraduate student of School of Computer Science from NPU(Northwestern Polytechnical University). And my research direction are OCR(Optical Character Recognition) and OCR based high-level Vision&Language Reasoning. Besides, I am also an arch(ArchLinux) user. I love linux-some great open-source softwares like vim, qtile, ranger and so on.

If you have any questions to communicate with me(linux, ocr, textvqa, textcaps, etc.), just feel free for contacting me by left-side email address.

Good luck to my future research life : )
